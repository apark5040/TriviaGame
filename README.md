# TriviaGame

This is a 5 question random trivia game where users must answer all questions within the time limit. 

The timer will start once the user hits the start button, and all the questions will be displayed. 

User must select an answer for each question. Once the timer hits 0, the game will tally up the answers and display the number of correct and incorrect answers. 

Andrew Park maintains and contributes to this project.
